===================================
This is a [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/guide) start-up project containing:
 * svelte 1.x
 * TypeScript 2.x
 * Webpack 3.x
 * Less

You can use ES6 in the svelte file, babel-loader will take care of the code compiled by svelte.

```
  # install

  # start develope for windows
  > npm run dev:win
```
